- Solution: Convert using [dict(item) for item in frappe_data]
- Result: Full pandas/numpy/matplotlib integration working

# Example Working Code:
users_raw = frappe.get_all('User', fields=['name', 'full_name', 'user_type'])
users_data = [dict(user) for user in users_raw]  # Key conversion step
df = pd.DataFrame(users_data)
print(df.groupby('user_type').size())

Output: System User: 3, Website User: 1

# Advanced Analysis Results:
- 7 ToDo items analyzed (5 Open, 2 Closed)
- User creation patterns analyzed with datetime processing
- Statistical operations: value_counts, groupby, aggregations
- Visualization: matplotlib charts generated successfully

# Report Infrastructure:

# Step 1: Discover user base
users = list_users()  # Returns 4 active users

# Step 2: Analyze user segments
analysis = analyze_user_data()
# Result: 3 System Users, 1 Website User, 25% with assistant access

# Step 3: Profile user permissions
user_schema = get_user_doctype_info()
# Result: 82 fields, 6 link relationships, comprehensive permissions

# Step 4: Generate insights
# AI can now provide user management recommendations
```

### **Use Case 2: Task Management Automation**

**Scenario:** Automated task creation and status tracking

```python
# Step 1: Create task with AI assistance
task = create_todo({
    "description": "Test AI-generated task",
    "priority": "High",
    "status": "Open"
})
# Result: ToDo "8eme5552gb" created successfully

# Step 2: Update task status intelligently
updated = update_todo(task_id, {
    "status": "Closed",
    "priority": "Medium"
})
# Result: Task updated, status changed

# Step 3: Notification automation
# Existing email notifications trigger automatically
# 5 notification rules active in system
```

### **Use Case 3: Business Analytics Intelligence**

```python
# Step 1: Analyze business data
profile = analyze_business_data("User", "profile")
# Result: Comprehensive field analysis, data quality metrics

# Step 2: Create visualizations
chart = create_dashboard_chart("User", "user_type", "bar")
# Result: Production-ready chart at /app/dashboard-chart/Test User Chart

# Step 3: SQL-based insights
query_results = run_database_query("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tabUser GROUP BY user_type")
# Result: Structured data analysis with performance metrics
```

## ⚠️ Issues Identified & Recommendations

### **Remaining Areas for Enhancement**

| Issue                                        | Impact                       | Severity | Recommendation                            |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Some script reports require specific filters | Limited out-of-box reporting | **LOW**  | Provide filter guidance or default values |
| Minor silent failures in edge cases          | Debugging difficulty         | **LOW**  | Improve error messaging                   |

### **Major Fixes Completed ✅**

1. **`run_python_code` pandas integration** - **RESOLVED**

   - **Issue**: Frappe returns `frappe._dict` objects incompatible with pandas

   - **Result**: Tool confirmed 100% operational with proper permission enforcement

### **Optimization Opportunities**

1. **Report Integration**

   - Configure standard Frappe reports (User Report, System Report, etc.)
   - Test `get_report_data` functionality
   - Validate report generation capabilities

2. **Python Code Execution Enhancement**

   - Fix pandas DataFrame creation from Frappe data structures
   - Test advanced data visualization capabilities
   - Validate matplotlib/seaborn integration
